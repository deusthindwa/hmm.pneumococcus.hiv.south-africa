Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults have higher risk of pneumococcal disease and carriage despite antiretroviral therapy. We estimated if HIV-infected adults disproportionally contribute to pneumococcal transmission in the household.

We constructed a hidden Markov model to capture the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage acquisition and clearance in families, who were followed-up twice weekly for their carriage incidence and tested using lytA real-time PCR. Inclusion of age, HIV status and presence of HIV-infected adult within household allowed estimation of respectively stratified intensities.

Of 1,684 individuals enrolled, 16.6% were <5 years-old children of whom 1.5% were HIV-infected. 17.9% of adults were HIV-infected, with high CD4+ count (82.2%). Preliminary modelling results suggest that 14.5% (95%CI:13.9,15.2) of pneumococcal-negative swabs were false negatives, annual carriage acquisition rates were not elevated in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected children (19.8, 95%CI:19.7,19.9 vs 20.8, 95%CI:20.6,21.5) or adults (14.3 ,95%CI:14.1,15.3 vs 15.1, 95%CI:14.8,15.3), and carriage duration in HIV-infected children (45.66 days, 95%CI:39.08,53.33) or adults (9.86 days, 95%CI:8.77,10.96) was not longer than among HIV-uninfected counterparts (57.71 days, 95%CI:51.87,64.65 and 12.42 days 95%CI:11.69,13.15). Childhood carriage acquisition was also similar in households with (19.6, 95%CI:19.4,21.0) or without (20.8,95%CI:20.6,23.9) HIV-infected adults.

HIV-infected adults are not more likely to transmit than HIV-uninfected adults in the household.
