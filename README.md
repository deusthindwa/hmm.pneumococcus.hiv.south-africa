Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus infected (HIV+) adults are at a higher risk of pneumococcal colonisation and disease, even if on antiretroviral therapy (ART). To subsequently be able to evaluate potential indirect effects of vaccination of HIV+ adults, we estimated if HIV+ adults disproportionately contribute to pneumococcal transmission in the household.

Methods
We constructed a hidden Markov model to capture the dynamics of pneumococcal carriage acquisition and clearance observed during a longitudinal household based nasopharyngeal swabbing study, while accounting for false negative tests. Households were followed-up twice weekly for a year for nasopharyngeal carriage detection via real-time PCR. Inclusion of the participant’s age, HIV status, presence of a HIV+ adult within the household and other covariates allowed estimation of the impact of such on pneumococcal acquisition and clearance rates.

Results
Of 1,684 individuals enrolled, 279 (16.6%) were <5 years-old children of whom 4 (1.5%) were HIV+. 245 (17.9%) of adults were HIV+, most (173, 81.2%) with high CD4+ count. We estimate that 14.4% (95%CI: 13.7-15.0) of pneumococcal-negative swabs were false negatives; i.e. a test sensitivity of 85.6% (85.0-86.3). Daily carriage acquisition rates among HIV- children were similar in households with HIV+ adults (0.076, 95%CrI: 0.069-0.083) and without HIV+ adults (0.072, 95%CrI: 0.066-0.079). The average carriage duration in HIV+ children (71 days, 95%CI: 61-82) and HIV+ adults (16 days, 95%CrI: 14-18) were not longer than among their HIV- counterparts (61 days, 95%CI: 55-67 and 14, 95%CI: 13-15). The use of both ART and antibiotics substantially reduced carriage duration but acquisition rates increased with household sizes.

Conclusion
South African HIV+ adults on ART show similar patterns of pneumococcal colonisation and onward transmission as their HIV- counterparts.
